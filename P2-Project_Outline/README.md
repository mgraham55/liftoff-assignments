## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will be creating a Dungeons and Dragons website where players can create and store characters. New players to D&D will be able to learn about all the different aspects that go into creating a new character and have a place to store any that want to make. Experienced players will be able to do the same but also use some features that are for more advanced players. The biggest reason for creating this is I hear people say so many times,"I wanna play D&D but never have. It seems to complicated.", when in reality it's not. I wanna introduce people to a whole new fun world.
### Features
User Login - The app would include a user login so you can create and account and store the character you make and not have to keep remaking them everytime you visit the sight. 
Create - The app would allow you to create a new character by choosing it's race, class, and abilities. If you have an account you will be able to store, delete, and edit them as well.

Randomize - This is similar to the create feature but it will just give you random everything for the options and be a fun way to play the game.

Description Page - Not so much a feature but I want to include a page of the rules of D&D, simple and advanced, so anyone can use the app.

Dice/Roll page - This kind of add onto the description page. It will explain the types of dice and when to use certain ones. It will also have a table of how and what to add to each roll for any combinaton of race/class.

Share - I would like to somehow add a way to be able to share the characters you make with others. This feature is still a ??? because I'm not sure how to do it.
### Technologies
MySQL
C#
JavaScript
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll be learning how to add some data from the D&D API into mine. If I want to include the share option for accounts I will need to learn how to do that.
